# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) in Go.

## Structure

Each day is self-contained in its own directory:

```
day01/
├── main.go       # Solution code
├── main_test.go  # Tests with sample inputs
└── input.txt     # Puzzle input (not tracked)
```

## Running Solutions

```bash
# Run a specific day
cd day01
go run main.go

# Run tests
go test

# Run all tests
go test ./...
```

## Progress

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 |
|-----|--------|--------|
| 1   | ⭐     | ⭐     |
| 2   |        |        |
| ... |        |        |

## Notes

Per Advent of Code's [legal notice](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about), puzzle inputs are not included in this repository.
